\begin{itemize}
    \item Concept of virtualization
    \item Hypervisors and their types
    \item Benefits of virtualization in modern computing
\end{itemize}

\section{Assignments and Practical Work}
\subsection{Assignment 1: Process Scheduling}
Students were tasked with implementing various process scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, SJN, and RR) and comparing their performance under different conditions.
\subsubsection{Group 1}
\begin{python}
    class Process:
    def __init__(self, pid, arrival_time, burst_time):
        self.pid = pid
        self.arrival_time = arrival_time
        self.burst_time = burst_time
        self.completion_time = 0
        self.turnaround_time = 0
        self.waiting_time = 0
\end{python}

\begin{table}[htbp] % Optional: For floating position
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} % Defines number of columns and alignment (c = center, l = left, r = right). '|' creates vertical lines.
    \hline
    Header 1 & Header 2 & Header 3 \\ % Column headers
    \hline
    Row 1, Column 1 & Row 1, Column 2 & Row 1, Column 3 \\ % First row of data
    \hline
    Row 2, Column 1 & Row 2, Column 2 & Row 2, Column 3 \\ % Second row of data
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Your table caption} % Optional: For adding a caption
    \label{tab:your_label} % Optional: For cross-referencing the table
\end{table}
\subsection{Assignment 2: Deadlock Handling}
In this assignment, students were asked to simulate different deadlock scenarios and explore various prevention methods.

\subsection{Assignment 3: Multithreading and Amdahl's Law}
This assignment involved designing a multithreading scenario to solve a computationally intensive problem. Students then applied **Amdahl's Law** to calculate the theoretical speedup of the program as the number of threads increased.

\subsection{Assignment 4: Simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) for User Interface Management}
Students were tasked with creating a simple **CLI** for user interface management. The CLI should support basic commands such as file manipulation (creating, listing, and deleting files), process management, and system status reporting.

\subsection{Assignment 5: File System Access}
In this assignment, students implemented file system access routines, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item File creation and deletion
    \item Reading from and writing to files
    \item Navigating directories and managing file permissions
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The first half of the course introduced core operating system concepts, including process management, scheduling, multithreading, and file system access. These topics provided a foundation for more advanced topics to be covered in the second half of the course.
